# About 🦣

Basic Weapons adds many new decorative blocks that are crafted within a new crafting interface, the Plushable Builder.  
These 'plushables' can have sound and particle effects on interaction, as well as animations.

# Getting Started 📖

- Pick up a copper ingot to unlock the recipe for the Plushable Builder in your recipe book, a block that is used to craft every plushable.
- Once you've crafted the builder you will be granted the Plushable Codex, a book item that details the recipes of every plush.
- Every plushable needs either a Heart of Gold or a Powered Heart of Gold. Both recipes can be found in your recipe book at the same time you unlock the builder recipe.
