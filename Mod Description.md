# Important¬†‚öîÔ∏è

Basic Weapons is a mod that works with¬†*Fabric*, _Quilt_ & _Forge_. Depending on which mod loader you're using you will¬†need to download different things:
| Using Fabric | [Fabric API](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) |
| ----- | ----- |
| Using Quilt | [Quilted Fabric API](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/qsl) |
| Using Forge | Nothing extra üëçüèΩ |

# About ü§∫

Basic Weapons adds **5** new weapon types of every vanilla tool material _(Wood, Stone, Iron, Gold, Diamond, Netherite)_ to complement the existing sword and axe in Minecraft. Each weapon is balanced around damage, attack speed, crafting costs and special effects. _If you have Better Combat installed, the weapons are also balanced around attack reach, number of enemies hit, and combos._

Weapons should feel _unique, powerful, easy to use_ and _fair._ I made Basic Weapons because I was looking around for weapon mods that would fit seamlessly into vanilla gameplay, and didn't quite find what I was looking for. I hope that in creating Basic Weapons, I've made that search a little easier for those of you who've had a similar experience.

This high level overview should give you an idea of what each weapon is good and bad at:

| Weapon         | Damage | Speed     | Baseline Effect      |
| -------------- | ------ | --------- | -------------------- |
| Vanilla Sword  | Medium | Medium    | Sweeping             |
| Vanilla Axe    | High   | Slow      | Shield Break         |
| Dagger         | Low    | Fast      |                      |
| Hammer         | High   | Very Slow | Knock target upwards |
| Quarterstaff\* | Low    | Medium    | Sweeping             |
| Spear\*        | Medium | Medium    |                      |
| Club           | High   | Slow      | Slow target          |

\*_The spear and quarterstaff are best used alongside Better Combat to utilize their full combat potential, but still work well as cheap weapons, and look very stylish when held._

# Better Combat Integration¬†üî•

![Better Combat + Basic Weapons](https://github.com/Khazoda/basic-weapons/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/bettercombat.png?raw=true)
Basic Weapons works well as a drop-in mod to spice up the weapon variety in your adventures, but it plays especially well when paired with [Better Combat](https://modrinth.com/mod/better-combat).

With Better Combat installed, spears gain more range, quarterstaves receive exciting new attack combos, daggers and clubs can be paired with other weapons for dual-wielding mayhem, and the hammer even features a fully custom attack animation.

If any of this sounds interesting to you, I recommend you try the two mods out together. [Better Combat](https://modrinth.com/mod/better-combat) can take some getting used to at first, but it's well worth your time investment in the long term, bringing a new layer of strategy and fun to your weapon choices and fights.

For weapon stats with Better Combat integration, see below:

| Weapon        | Damage | Speed     | Baseline Effect      | Targets | Reach     | Weapon-Type |
| ------------- | ------ | --------- | -------------------- | ------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Vanilla Sword | Medium | Medium    | Vanilla Sweeping     | Multi   | Medium    | One-handed  |
| Vanilla Axe   | High   | Slow      | Vanilla Shield Break | Single  | Medium    | One-handed  |
| Dagger        | Low    | Fast      |                      | Single  | Medium    | One-handed  |
| Hammer        | High   | Very Slow | Knock target upwards | Single  | Medium    | One-handed  |
| Quarterstaff  | Low    | Medium    | Vanilla Sweeping     | Hybrid  | High      | Two-handed  |
| Spear         | Medium | Slow      |                      | Single  | Very High | Two-handed  |
| Club          | High   | Slow      | Slow target          | Single  | Medium    | One-handed  |

## More Weapon Stats (Just in-case you want them) üò∫

### This table shows the baseline stats for each weapon type. Tier modifiers apply after these stats (i.e. Wood/Stone/Iron etc.), but this table should give you a good idea of how each weapon compares to the next.

#### Some stats have specifically tailored changes to tiers, such as the hammer. Due to its very powerful effect, early hammer tiers' damage values are nerfed in comparison to their higher tier counterparts, though their attack speed is comparatively higher. This damage tweaking based on tier is present in vanilla's axe weapon damage values too.

| Weapon       | Damage per attack | Number of attacks per second | Weapon reach in number of blocks (req. Better Combat) |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Dagger       | 1                 | 2                            | 2.25                                                  |
| Quarterstaff | 1                 | 1.7                          | 3.25                                                  |
| Spear        | 2                 | 1.2                          | 4.0                                                   |
| Sword        | 3                 | 1.6                          | 2.5                                                   |
| Club         | 5                 | 1.0                          | 2.5                                                   |
| Axe          | 6                 | 0.8                          | 2.5                                                   |
| Hammer       | 7                 | 0.6                          | 2.5                                                   |
